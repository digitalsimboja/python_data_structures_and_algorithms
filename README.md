# Meaning of Data Structures

Data Structures are efficient ways of organizing data for easy accessibilty  
and manipulations

# Meaning of Algorithms

Algorithms are steps or processes involved in organizing and manipulating data

We use data structures and algorithms to develop memory and time efficient  
applications.

## Problem solving

## Understand the problem

- Restate the problem in your own words
- What are the inputs to the problem
- What are the expected outputs
- Can the outputs be derivable from the input i.e do we have enough information about this problem or we need external information?
- How do I lable the importance piece of data that are part of the problem

## Explore Examples

- Start with simple examples
- Progress to more complex examples
- Explore examples with empty inputs
- Explore the examples with invalid inputs

## Break the steps down

Write a minute pseudo code on the steps to take to solve the problem

## Solve and simplify the problem

- Find the core difficulty
- Temporarily ignore the difficulty
- Write simplified solution
- Incorporate the difficulty

## Look back and refactor
- check the result
- drive the result differently
- understand it at a glance
- reusability
- optimize or improve performance
- how other people solve this problem
